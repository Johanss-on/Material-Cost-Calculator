# Sheet Cost Calculator

This Python-based sheet cost calculator helps calculate the mass and cost of sheets based on their dimensions and material density. It's a useful tool for quickly determining the cost of material sheets in various manufacturing and production processes.

## Features

- Calculate mass and cost of sheets based on length, width, thickness, and material density.
- Choose from predefined material densities (Steel, Stainless Steel, Aluminium) or input custom density.
- Option for demo mode to simulate data for multiple sheets.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sheet-cost-calculator.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd sheet-cost-calculator
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. If not, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You don't need any additional dependencies for this project, as it uses built-in Python libraries.

# Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
     cd path/to/sheet-cost-calculator
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
    python3 calculate_sheet_cost_CLI.py
4. The program will ask whether you want to run it in demo mode. You can choose:

y for demo mode (automatically generates data).

n for manual input of sheet dimensions.

e to exit the program.

After entering the number of sheets, it will ask for the details (length, width, thickness) for each sheet. Once entered, it will calculate and display the mass and cost of each sheet.
